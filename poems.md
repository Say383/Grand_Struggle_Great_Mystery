# The Grand Struggle
The Grand Struggle cannot be defined or articulated directly. Only through example, anecdote, parable, and suggestion can it be elucidated. This is the way that Eastern wisdom has been taught for millennia. From Taoism to Buddhism, the thing cannot described except indirectly. That does not mean it is ineffable. But rather, that the best way to teach it is to circumscribe it. This is the same way you catch a fish with a net. The words are the net, the Grand Struggle is the fish. Once you have the fish, you no longer need the words. 

## Evolution
One organism lives, another dies, and the universe learns.
This is the nature of the Grand Struggle.

## Empires
Empires rise and fall.
Like the ebb and flow of the tides.

This is the way of things. 
Every civilization goes through its own seasons.
This and that empire rise to prominence, then fall by the wayside.

Supplanted by another.
This is the Grand Struggle.

## Companies
All companies die, eventually.
In their infancy, they take uncertain, shaky steps. 
In their midlife, they are at their most productive.
In their twilight, they slowly become quieter. 
Like the cycle of birth, life, and death, so too do they succumb to the Grand Struggle. 

## Youth
The spring renewal of life,
Ever cycling on and on.
The fresh-faced beauty, inevitably lost to wrinkles. 

It is the way of things, for the young to become old.
For the beautiful to wither. 

The fires of adolescence clearing the forest, again and again.
Burnt cinders to start over. 
This is the Grand Struggle. 

## Art
The soul of the artist, bursting with expression.
Beauty, they say, in the eye of the beholder. 
Remembered long after they are gone. 
Ignored in life. Misunderstood. 
This is the Grand Struggle.

## Plague
Viral plague, wreaking havoc within. 
Surmount or succumb, it is the way of things. 
A test of mettle. 
Live or die, with medicine or alone, the universe learns. 
In this way, the Grand Struggle plays out within.

## Status
Yearning to be seen, to be top dog.
We all climb as high as we can. 
Subsidence for those who falter. 
Limitless growth for those who can continue.
Different rules for different games, some finite, some infinite.
We all play in the Grand Struggle. 

## Religion
The holy scripture of one, meaningless drivel to another.
That which is sacrosanct, only as strong as the arms that keep it.
All gods turn to dust, eventually. 

Only the churn persists, the Grand Struggle.

## Dynasty
Bloodlines unbroken for centuries,
Eventually end. 
The family legacy, large or small, only memories and ashes. 

What was once mighty and lofty, vaunted and revered,
Becomes disgusting and hollow, replaced by another lineage.
So goes the Grand Struggle.

## Politics
One party, two, or more, it matters little. 
The competition is all there is. Dominance, victory. 
This ideology or that, all narratives spun from webs of words. 
This is the battle of rhetoric, of wit. There is only the game.
Only the Grand Struggle. 

## Negotiation
The ultimate test of wit, of preparation.
The meeting of minds, one wins, one loses. 
Whether haggling over goats or billion dollar deals, it is all the same. 
A million choices and tests led you here.
This is your Grand Struggle. 

## Disability
Whether the mind or body is sick, it is your burden to bear. 
Every day is a struggle, a fight to stay alive. 
Whether the will of a malevolent god or the happenstance of a careless universe.
Your disability is your Grand Struggle. 

## Self
The ultimate test – 
is the one within the self. 
The Grand Struggle to overcome your foibles, your prejudices. 
This is the perpetual struggle, forever and anon.

## Education
The child goes in, naïve. 
The adult comes out, jaded. 
Was it the institution, or the confrontation with reality?
Perhaps a bit of both. 
There is the ranking and grading, scores and points. 
All are equal, all are measured. Some are lacking more than others. 
This is the Grand Struggle of the mind – a forging of synapses, a test. 

## Money
Those who have it, want more of it. 
Those without, hate it. 
It can be counted, hoarded, spent thoughtlessly, accumulated. 
It is an expression of humanity. 
If money is the root of all evil, but is an invention of humanity, then we are the source of evil. 
But money is also energy, it can compel great works of art and engineering, or great acts of destruction. 
Money is neutral. Humanity decides the cardinality, the disposition. 
It is an expression of the Grand Struggle. 

## Climb
Whether you’re climbing stairs or Mount Everest, or something in between.
It is the struggle that counts.
The result matters little, in the end. The story of how you got there is what is interesting. 
It is not the smooth sailing and easy days that you recall in the years that follow.
It is not how simple the task was that is told about you.
It is the Grand Struggle that is remembered. 

## Change
All stories begin with a change. 
Fictional or otherwise, equilibrium is uninteresting. We do not tell stories of menial labors and boring anecdotes.
Above all else, we crave the Grand Struggle, to see people transformed, changed by their experiences. 
This is what interests us. It is human nature. 

## War
War decides not who is right, only who is left. 
Those who remain, by the test of it, had something superior about them. 
Whether it was their training, their resources, or the favor of their gods.
It is the contest of dominance, played out on the world’s stage. 
The Grand Struggle between nations, allies, and enemies. 

## Survival
Our ancestors who laid down and died,
Did not pass on their genes.
Those who fought, who threw caution to the wind, who scraped and clawed and mauled,
Persisted. 
We are their inheritors, the victors of the Grand Struggle.
Life is the ultimate test.

## Loyalty
Cherished loved ones,
Will break your heart, and you theirs. 
We only hurt the ones we love. 
Forgiveness, understanding, compassion, and the courage to repair a rupture. 
This is the test of loyalty.
In its own little way, part of the Grand Struggle. 

## Oath
Your word is your bond.
Or it isn’t. 
The choice is yours. 
Just remember – 
your actions have consequences.
This is the Grand Struggle at play.

## Games
Locked in a battle
As real as any
The ball, the hands, the rules
Warriors, all
In their own right
Paragons of strength
Points scored, victories won
Coaches are generals
In this Grand Struggle, writ small

## Toys
“Mine!” shouts a child
As he strikes another
The competition for dominance
Has begun
Affection of Mother and Father
The silent war of loud jealousy
The Grand Struggle starts at birth
In the womb for some

## Ideology
I am right, and you are wrong
For I make sense to my own mind
And you do not
Unseen are your heritage, your homeland
What works for you – 
Alien to me
This is the frustration of the Great Mystery

## Rage
Injustice wrought
Affect of anger
This is the signal
The calling
Of the Grand Struggle
To right a wrong
Lest a transgression go unpunished
The tribal way

## Soldiers
Young men march to war
How cruel it is
That the next generation should perish
In the ultimate contest
Of survival and dominance
These are the demands
Of the Grand Struggle

## Knife
A dagger in the dark
Can change history
One motivated agent
Obedient to the Grand Struggle
Neither right nor wrong
It simply is

## Earth
Our home, the Blue Jewel
Gigantic, shrinking every day
Our elbows and knees
Crowd each other
The final battlefield appears
One sphere, then another
The Grand Struggle expands ever 

## Crops
Rain falls
Wind blows
The crop thrives
So too the locusts
Farmers spray
Corporations engineer the seed
Insects evolve
The Grand Struggle cycles on and on

## Narratives
Words are but wind
Arbitrary collections of symbols, sounds
Meaning is ascribed only by the recipient
And yet
Words conquer worlds
Stories shape civilization
Narratives coordinate Nations
The Grand Struggle
Is only a narrative

## Rest
Even soldiers on the battlefield
Must catch their breath
The toil of a day ends at night
The Grand Struggle awaits, does not forget
The ragged warrior, spent of endurance cannot fight on
Rekindle the spirit
Live to fight another day

## Strength
The power of arms
To make change upon the world
Is better to have, than none at all
For those without
Are at the mercy of those with
It is neither right nor wrong
It is merely the Grand Struggle

## Injustice
What is fair?
It is a wish in the wind
Life is not fair, this we know
Whatever injustice you face, 
Whatever unfairness besets your life, 
The obstacle is the way
Your injustice is your Grand Struggle


# The Great Mystery

## Curiosity
Born with a probing mind, a blessing and a curse. 
The danger of asking questions, is they have answers. 
Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back. 
This is the nature of the Great Mystery.

## Universe
The goldfish,
Gazing at the inside of his bowl – 
has no idea how or why it came to be. 
Situated within, it may be impossible to understand,
The world without. 
We may never know. This is part of the Great Mystery.

## Ignorance
It is a fool’s errand to try and overcome ignorance,
To try and claim the fruit of wisdom, to ascertain knowledge and certainty.
Yet we strive all the same. Unable to stop.
Compelled to learn, to seek, to ask. 
We revile our ignorance, while we should cherish it. 
This is our attitude towards the Great Mystery.

## Death
A path that we all must take, sooner or later.
Beyond the veil, many claim to know what lies. 
No one really knows.
Yet everyone will learn. 
This is your future with the Great Mystery.

## Cosmos
Finite or infinite, we may debate for eternity.
The scale of the cosmos defies reason, impossible for our minds to compass. 
Lightyears are just numbers. The vastness, truly ineffable. 
Countless worlds unseen, unknown, unexplored, swallowed by oblivion,
Long before we can lay eyes on them, set foot upon them. 
This is the truth of the Great Mystery.

## Consciousness
We are awake. 
Or are we?
Whether it’s a fever dream, a simulation, or something else. 
The qualia of life, the sights and sounds and texture of thought. 
When you reflexively ponder your own inner workings, you quickly find the dead end. 
Sentience, a gift and a curse, is another facet of the Great Mystery.

## Possibilities
What could have been?
Had you made a different choice. 
The path not taken.
Endless possibilities, all withered on the vine. 
The Great Mystery keeps her secrets.

## Question
Interrogatives – the name of the act
To ask a question, to ponder
The ability sublime, a gift of Nature
Spoken aloud, articulated and finite
You ask the question, awaiting and answer
It may never come, ever seeking
But there it remains – the question
This is the conspiracy of the Great Mystery

## Lover
Gazing into the eyes
Of dearest beloved
Thoughts locked away
Ephemeral moment
What emotions find anchorage there?
The deepest harbor
It is all part
Of the Great Mystery

## Books
Millions of stories
Mold and mildew reclaimed
Rotting on the shelves
Of minds and libraries
Forgotten pages
Of the Great Mystery

## Nyx
Darkest Night
Impenetrable Veil
Silent Goddess that Zeus feared
Mother of terror
Keeper of secrets
The Great Mystery – 
Hers to keep

## Shadow
What lurks within
The shade and shadow
Scorned by light
Withering from sight
Shying from prying eyes
This is the soul of the Great Mystery

## Questions
Why, daddy?
How, mommy?
Forty thousand strong
We are born with Legion
Burning questions, yearning for answers
From our first words
We want to know
We are in live with the Great Mystery

## Corners
Just out of sight
Hidden from view
Anything can be there
Just around the bend

## Doorways
Turn the knob
Peak behind
The mind races to know
Courage builds pressure within
To throw open the passage
The Great Mystery compels

## Telescopes
Magnificent eyes
Peer into the dark
Billions of dollars
To see long dead stars
This is the power
Of the Great Mystery

## Microscopes
Worlds within worlds
All around, totally invisible
It’s a question of scale
Important all the same
Do not be afraid
To interrogate that speck
In service to
The Great Mystery

## Cave
Deepest dark
Endless depth
Water coursing down
Returning to the source
Its path unknown
Will surface again
So too flows the Great Mystery

## Future
Shrouded in mists
Past and future the same
Obscured from view
How to get there from here
No sage can know
Yet tomorrow will become today
And tomorrow –
Will always be
Just out of reach
This is the agony of the Great Mystery

## Dreams
Dear Morpheus, son of Nyx
Bringer of Dreams
Grains of sand
Messages from the deep
Clues to the murmurings
Voice of the abyss
Your world within
Participates in the Great Mystery

## Scent
You smell it on the wind
Half remembered
Who was it?
Where?
When?
A confabulated memory, or real
Gone already
It’s too late
The Great Mystery persists

## Stone
A rock loosed from hand
Child or man, sailing through the air
Splashing down, in lake, creek, or sea
Will it settle there?
Or cascade down
Through the ages
Ground to dust
It is all part and parcel
Of the Great Mystery

## Fog
Transient mists over a silent mountain
Drifting in from the sea
Sipping Redwoods, quenched by clouds
Like time and war
Vision cut short
Your world small
When it clears
The world grows
This is the pattern of the Great Mystery

## Science
We are stupid
And feeble of mind
Three pounds of gray matter
Can comprehend the cosmos?
Don’t make me laugh
Bushing back the veil of ignorance
One formula at a time
The Great Mystery beckons

## Definitions
If you find yourself
Poring over the words
Dissecting their meaning
You don’t have it yet
Keep reading
The Great Mystery cannot be defined
But it can be circumscribed

## Wonder
The pursuit of the sublime
Awe of creation
The greatest gift, the frisson of ineffable beauty
To take in the grandeur of a canyon
The majesty of the mountain
The power of the sundering seas
To feel small before the Great Mystery
There is nobility in this

## Childhood
Born into the world
Unknowing
Synaptic connections, the self-assembling mind
Questions abound, lessons learned
Many painful experiences, the teachers of life
To start naïve, innocent, what a wonderful gift
Our offspring carry the Great Mystery 
Like a teddy bear, bravely into the unknown

## Exploration
The horizon beckons
For to see what lies beyond
Humanity’s insatiable curiosity
Unquenchable hunger to know
We set sail on tiny vessels, to the ends of the earth
Tin cans launched into space
We go everywhere
Compelled by the Great Mystery

## Abyss
The benthic plains of the cosmos
Deep crushing dark
Frigid life, lurking below
What lies beyond the Veil of Forms
Above and below
Ghosts, spirits, demons, dreaming gods
The endless dark
The halls of the Great Mystery

## Horizons
TBD

## Toddler
TBD

# Hybrids

## Name
What’s in a name?
Jean-Paul Sartre
Myocardial infarction
Epistemic tribe
The Great Apes only
Can name names
The Grand Struggle
And the Great Mystery
Names bely the reality

## Fossil
Leg bone
Perilous journey
Final resting place
Ossification
How was your life?
A fascinating tale, untold
Only your story, none other
A single thread
Of the Great Mystery
An end of one Grand Struggle
